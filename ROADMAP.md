- [ ] Assign a unique color to each essential oil or raw material  
- [ ] Define evaporation time (duration) for each note  
- [ ] Generate a visual blend of the formula, where:  
  - Colors are mixed based on ingredient proportions  
  - Colors fade progressively as top, heart, and base notes evaporate  
- [ ] Include interactive options:  
  - View full fragrance color blend  
  - Isolate and view top, heart, or base layers separately  
  - Use a time slider to preview how the fragrance "color" changes over time  

> This feature is experimental and designed to help perfumers "see" their fragrance structure and evolution — a powerful way to prototype and understand olfactory dynamics visually.
